# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict handwritten digits from images. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and is capable of identifying digits from 0 to 9 based on an image input. The application allows users to draw a digit on a canvas, which is then sent to the server for prediction.

## Features

- **Digit Drawing**: Users can draw digits on a canvas using their mouse or touch input.
- **Prediction**: Once the user submits the drawing, the model predicts the digit and returns the probability of that prediction.
- **Clear Canvas**: Users can clear the canvas to make a new drawing.
- **Real-time Inference**: The application provides immediate feedback by displaying the predicted digit and its probability.
